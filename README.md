## What is Supermech?

Supermech transforms agent-driven workflows from terminal/Markdown interactions into a **data-driven visual platform**. Agents write structured JSON → the frontend renders real-time visualizations → user feedback writes back to JSON for the next agent iteration.

It's designed as a **low-invasion sidecar**: any project (Node, Python, Go, or otherwise) can add a `.supermech/` directory and immediately begin using Supermech skills.

### Current Baseline

This `README` and [`docs/当前实施重规划.md`](/Users/macxm/service/codex/superpowers-plus/docs/当前实施重规划.md) are the current execution baseline.

- The primary state model is plan-scoped, skill-scoped files: `.supermech/<plan>/state-<skill>.json`
- `sessionId` identifies a run/session context and must not be treated as the skill name
- Historical docs may still mention a single `state.json`, fixed canvas assumptions, or older dependency-field drafts; treat those as background unless restated here

### Current Skills

| Skill | View | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **brainstorming** | MindMap (SVG tree) | Socratic design exploration → structured decisions |
| **writing-plans** | PlanEditor (tree + detail) | Implementation plans with TDD steps and quality gates |
| **executing-plans** | FlowchartCanvas + DetailPanel | Execution with run/review/debug/completion semantics, subagent/inline modes |

Skills are **independent** — not a pipeline. Use only what you need.

`writing-plans` is the execution handoff point. Choosing an execution mode should create or hydrate `state-executing-plans.json` from the current plan.

**Phase C** adds run/review/debug/completion semantics to `executing-plans` instead of creating new top-level canvases. Execution runs (`implementer`, `spec-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`) track who did what, debug traces surface investigation steps per task, and completion checks gate the finish-ready signal at canvas level.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm (for development)

### Try the workbench

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/supermech.git
cd supermech
pnpm install
pnpm dev:web
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see the workbench.

### Add Supermech to your project

```bash
npx @supermech/init
```

Creates `.supermech/` plus installs skill definitions to `.claude/skills/`. Your agent can now discover and use `supermech-brainstorming`, `supermech-writing-plans`, and `supermech-executing-plans`.

```bash
npx @supermech/cli
```

Starts the visual workbench at `localhost:4388`. Agent writes state → UI renders in real time.

### Agent writes state

Agent creates a plan directory based on the request topic and writes structured JSON:

```
.supermech/用户认证/state-brainstorming.json
```

`activeSkill` and `canvas.skillType` carry the skill identity. `sessionId` is a separate run/session identifier.

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "projectName": "用户认证",
    "sessionId": "用户认证--brainstorming",
    "activeSkill": "brainstorming",
    "agentStatus": "writing"
  },
  "canvas": {
    "skillType": "brainstorming",
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "root", "label": "认证方案", "status": "active", "progress": 0.5, "parentId": null, "children": [], "metadata": {} }
    ]
  },
  "feedback": [],
  "ui": { "theme": "system", "leftSidebarOpen": true, "rightSidebarOpen": true, "selectedNodeId": null }
}
```

## How It Works

```
Agent (Brain)          React Frontend (Canvas)
    │                        │
    │   writes state file    │
    ├───────────────────────►│  Vite plugin → HMR → re-render
    │                        │
    │  ◄─────────────────────┤  User action → middleware → write state file
    │   reads feedback       │
```

**Data flow:**

1. **Agent → JSON**: Agent executes a skill and writes structured JSON to `.supermech/<plan>/state-<skill>.json`
2. **JSON → UI**: The Vite plugin watches the file → invalidates the virtual module → sends HMR event → React Context re-fetches via GET
3. **UI → JSON**: User interacts (clicks, rates, annotates) → Context calls middleware API → middleware writes the update to file
4. **JSON → Agent**: Agent reads the state file on the next iteration, including any new `feedback[]` entries

### Directory Layout

```
.supermech/                     # Standard product directory (config + skills + plan-scoped state)
├── config.json                 # Workspace configuration (optional)
├── skills/                     # Agent discovers skills by listing this directory
│   ├── visual-brainstorming/   #   SKILL.md defines behavior
│   ├── visual-writing-plans/
│   └── visual-executing-plans/
└── 用户认证/                    # One plan directory per work topic
    ├── state-brainstorming.json
    ├── state-writing-plans.json
    └── state-executing-plans.json

packages/
├── schemas/                    # @supermech/schema — types + runtime validation
├── watcher/                    # @supermech/runtime — file I/O + Vite plugin
└── init/                       # @supermech/init — project initializer

apps/web/                       # React frontend (Vite + React 18 + Tailwind v4)
```

## Packages

Supermech is published as three npm packages, each independently usable:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`@supermech/schema`](./packages/schemas/) | TypeScript types + zod schemas for `WorkbenchState`. Validates state files at runtime. Zero dependencies. |
| [`@supermech/runtime`](./packages/watcher/) | `readState()` / `writeState()` / `watchState()` for agent scripts. Includes a Vite plugin for the workbench UI. |
| [`@supermech/init`](./packages/init/) | `initProject()` to bootstrap `.supermech/` directory in any project. |

---

## Development

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd supermech
pnpm install
pnpm dev:web    # Start workbench at localhost:5173
pnpm typecheck  # TypeScript check across all packages
pnpm check      # Biome lint + format
pnpm check:fix  # Auto-fix issues
```

### Project Structure

```
apps/web/          — React workbench (Vite + React 18 + Tailwind v4 + i18n)
packages/schemas/  — @supermech/schema: types + zod validation
packages/watcher/  — @supermech/runtime: file I/O + Vite plugin
packages/init/     — @supermech/init: project initializer
skills/            — Legacy skill definitions (migrating to .supermech/skills/)
docs/              — Product docs and sample state snapshots
```

---

## Architecture

- **No build step for packages** — TypeScript sources consumed directly (workspace resolution)
- **State file as protocol** — JSON file is the single source of truth; no database, no service
- **HMR-driven UI** — Vite plugin watches file changes and pushes to React via custom HMR events
- **Plan-scoped states** — Optional plan subdirectories for parallel work contexts
- **Extensible skills** — Add a skill by creating `.supermech/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; no framework changes needed

---

## Design Principles

1. **Low invasion** — A `.supermech/` directory and a few JSON files is all a project needs. No framework lock-in.
2. **Skill independence** — Skills are not a pipeline. Use only what you need.
3. **Agent-owned state** — The agent controls status transitions; the UI provides visualization and feedback.
4. **Runtime validation** — Every state mutation is validated against the schema before write.
